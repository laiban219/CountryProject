		of fasting. It begins and ends with the appearance of the crescent moon. Fasting during
		Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam and is a way for believers to show their thanks 
		to God and reflect on the teachings of the Quran.  Muslims often give chariety more often, attend 
		tarawill that are prayers at night, fast from sunrise to sunset, pray 5 times each day and 
		read the Quran more often.  Ramadan usually lasts for about 29 to 30 days and Muslims 
		celebrate Eid Al-Fitr after the last day of Ramadan. </div>

		and hot during the whole year in Saudi Arabia, 
		so it has been recommended to not wear many layers.  Also, Muslims in Saudi Arabia dress
		modestly, so they usually wear clothes that are oversized instead of clothes that cling 
		to the contour of your body.  Men and women are required to cover as much skin as possible.  
		T-shirts are acceptable when the sleeves are below your elbow, and women are not allowed to
		wear shorts, but men can wear shorts that cover their knees. </div>

		is where the kaaba is located.  Muslims pray 5 times a day and the prayers
		are called Fajr, zuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and lastly Isha.  Salat al-fajr is prayed
		at dawn or at any time before sunrise.  Salat al-zuhr is prayed during the middle
		of the day.  Salat al-’asr is prayed during the afternoon and salat al-maghrib
		is prayed after sunset. 
		Lastly, salat al-’isha is prayed between the time from sunset to midnight. </div>

		Starting from a young age, Muslims are taught how to read the
		Qu’ran, and the Qu’ran is a holy book. In Islam, the only one God is Allah.  
		The Qu’ran is written in Arabic and it contains many words that have been
		believed to be stated by Allah(God).  Also, the Qu’ran states the truth and 
		guidance for every human being.  The Qu’ran has stories about each prophet 
		from the past, there are 114 chapters (surahs), and the chapters are divided 
		into 30 sections.  The Qu’ran has about 604 pages in most of the copies of this
		holy book and whoever reads the Qu’ran will earn some benefits.

		Muslims in Saudi Arabia offer generosity and hospitality to strangers, 
		friends, and their family. The simplest expression of hospitality is coffee 
		and its preparation alone is an intricate cultural tradition. Coffee is often
		served in small cups along with dates and sweets.  Another gesture of 
		hospitality is the burning of incense (oud) to welcome guests.  Muslims
		are very generous because they know that they are blessed and they have
		an obligation to share with other people who are less fortunate compared to themselves.
